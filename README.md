[h1]FortifAI[/h1]

This mod gives all AI-cities much stronger defense and offense capabilities to counter player snowballing to a high degree.

[b]Features[/b]
The intention of this mod is to reduce the snowballing on the domination-victory and give a reasonable incentive to try other victories because domination, with this mod, can quiet be stressful XD

This mod does not change any *strategic* AI behavior, which means it should work great with AI-behavior mods.
The playstyle with this mod gets a lot more "asymmetrical" against the AI, since it is game-difficulty independent, which results in a more challenging game even on lower difficulties if a true domination-victory is a thing for you ;)

To summarize it somewhat:
- AI gets free defense buildings depending on eras and population
- AI gets a fortify-against-humanity-trait which helps cities in healing defenses and garrison (lay siege to reduce!)
- AI gets occasionally free promotions/units depending on relative strength and if on offense or defense
- AI gets eco-boost depending on relative strength and if on offense or defense and if losing units
- AI gets units heal buffs if human attacks with ranged attacks, can be countered by using melee units adjacent
- AI gets a damage boost against human city defenses, dangerous if the gets to siege a human players city
- No possibility of winning against AI with "kind-of-domination-victory" if domination victory is disabled! (If a AI is the last living civ, it cities gets invincible)
- AI will forget on a slower rate your aggressiveness!
- Overall AI-Toughness is configurable in the mods config-file

All this only kicks in on AI vs. Human or vice versa, AI vs. AI is not modified.
Having some AI allies is more of a help then ever!

If you're a player who don't like asymmetrical gameplay, this mod is _not_ for you.
